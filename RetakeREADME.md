## Personal Thoughts
Due to my lack of understanding and ability in some areas of code, I was unable to meet all the criteria for my original project. Looking back at this I can fully understand why this was the case, and I have done my very best to take the assessors constructive critisim onboard, and have gone back at this project with a renewed look and vision, and have rectified my failings.

## **Fixes**

### **Fix One**
***
In order to try and remove the red underline in this code, as it was throwing an error ('line too long') within my code, I used the '\' function to cut the lines in half. Due to this '\' it caused my sign in and sign up functions to fail from the get go. This was an oversight on my part, and will be an error I will not be making in the future. I would rather have a few squiggly red underlines within my code, than app breaking code but clean, error free code.

### **Fix Two**
***
This fix was less simple, and required me to take a long hard look at the user experience within the app. I orginally thought that I would be able to go through the admin page to create 'blogs' or 'posts' for my users, but this was clearly a huge oversight on my part, and I'm not quite sure what I was thinking. I'm going to put the blame on a very bad week at work for that decision! However, with this in mind, I tackled the issue head on and created the code that would allow users to create their own posts, edit them and then delete them. I have also allowed them the ability to view all their own posts on their own individual profile.

Below are screen shots of the new content that has been implimented into the application.

## **Future Implications**

***
If I had been given longer to retake this Project (ideally if I had completed it correctly to begin with) I would have liked to impliment some of the following;
    
- likes and comments; as found in the blog section
- the ability to click on someones comment to take you to their profile page
    - though I like to think this would be as simple as adding an < a > to the blog_details page by the 'comment.name', it is something I'd like to look into properly.
- I would like the ability to allow users to access their drafts so they can edit and post them when they are ready too, rather than relying on the admin to post it for them.
